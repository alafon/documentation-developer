# Trainings

TODO: Introduction to trainings

## Learning path

Each training starts with a list of the trainings you should previously master before going into this one.

## Training environment

You'll need a training instance of Ibex DXP.

Each training starts with its technical requirements.
Some trainings provide some additional set-up like code, content, or config.

You can use whatever solution that suits you to run an Ibexa DXP in the required edition for your training.
You'll need to access the Ibexa DXP code, the servers' configs, and command lines.

[DDEV](install_with_ddev.md) can be used to build such training installation.
